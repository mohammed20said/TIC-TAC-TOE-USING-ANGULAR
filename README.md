Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The game involves two players, usually represented by "X" and "O". The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

In the Angular implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, the game board is represented using a 3x3 grid of buttons. Each button represents a square on the game board. When a player clicks on a button, their corresponding mark ("X" or "O") is placed in that square. The game alternates between the two players, with each player taking turns to place their mark.

The Angular implementation of Tic Tac Toe provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for players to enjoy the game, with real-time updates of the game state and visual feedback indicating the winner or a draw.
